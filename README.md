# EriUnits

Hello, and welcome to the homepage of EriUnits, a World of Warcraft addon for unit frames.

The goal of this project is to provide a powerful framework to create customized unit frames for a variety of purposes that are perfectly suited to your preferences. Whether you want raid frames, party frames, separate, together, grouped by class, grouped by party, whether you want resource bars, perhaps only on some types of frames, whether you want debuffs, dispellable or not, no matter what you want, this addon is designed to provide the complete flexibility to easily implement your unit frame needs.

Many unit frame addons work out of the box, others are rather customizable and require some effort to make them effective. This addon has no such goal, out of the box it does absolutely nothing. Think WeakAuras, except specifically designed for unit frames.

It *is* a goal for this addon to be completely unobtrusive to other addons or the game interface itself without you explicitly adding functionality.
